# Welcome to Jamf Charts in 10 minutes!

This project was inspired by a long 2018 summer where my organization migrated from Exchange 2010 to Office 365. Jamf was successfully able to deploy the application changes and track it's progress. However, Jamf has no convenient way to report these changes. No, _show in dashboard_ is not a solution for a Project Manager or C level.

This Feature Request from 2015 is still under review: https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/feature-requests/3415/ability-for-casper-to-produce-management-friendly-graphs

Shout out to [Apple Admins of Seattle and the Great Northwest](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Apple-Admins) for letting me present this.

To provide data about your mac fleet that's easily consumable and easy to build. There are many ways to skin a house cat that keeps you up at night. If your first thought is _i could have done this in Python_, this project isn't for you. Hi, Frogor.

I was very new sysadmin and building this introduced me to things like `git`, `curl` and `awk`.

## How To
