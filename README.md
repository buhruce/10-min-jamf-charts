# Welcome to Jamf Charts in 10 minutes!

This project was inspired by a long 2018 summer where my organization migrated from Exchange 2010 to Office 365. Jamf was successfully able to deploy the application changes and track it's progress. However, Jamf has no convenient way to report these changes. No, _show in dashboard_ is not a solution for a Project Manager or C level.

I took to the internets and found this FR request from homebysix on jamfnation.  

Shout out to [Apple Admins of Seattle and the Great Northwest](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Apple-Admins) for letting me present this keynote last year.

## Purpose

This is meant for green jamf admins. I've noticed Jamf admins tend to be either still in help desk or new to system administration. This project is taylored to them and will introduce things like `git` `curl` and `awk`. If your first thought is _i could have done this in Python_, this project isn't for you. Hi, Frogor.

## How To

I made a wiki with a walk through!

## Future

Currently in the progress of redoing this all in Python and a customized chart.js.
